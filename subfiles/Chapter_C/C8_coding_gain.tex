\subsection{Coding Gain in AWGN Channel}
Consider the following graphic.\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/coding_gain.png}
At low $E_b/N_0$ uncoded signals have a lower BER (bit-error rate) than coded signals. But as $E_b/N_0$ increases, coded signals are better.\\
\begin{definition}
    Coding Gain: the improvement in power saving, $E_b/N_0$ at the same BER.
