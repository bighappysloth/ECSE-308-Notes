\subsubsection{Problem C1}
\begin{wts}
  A transmission link with a bit error rate of p = 0.001 is used for transferring 10-byte frames. Calculate
\begin{enumalpha}
    \item The probability that there is exactly one error bit in the received frame?
    \item What is the frame error probability, i.e., the probability that the received frame contains at least one error bit?
    \item 
    If the frame length is halved, what is the frame error probability?
\end{enumalpha}
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
Let $n = 80$ bits. Using the Binomial distribution, it is trivial to verify that
\subsubsection*{Part A}
The probability there is one error bit in the frame is given by 
\[
P(k=1) = \binom{n}{1}p(1-p)^{n-1} = 0.0739
\]
\subsubsection*{Part B}
The probability that there is at least one error is given by
\[
P(k\geq 1) = 1 - (1-p)^n = 0.0769
\]

\subsubsection*{Part C}
The probability of a frame error given $m=n/2 = 40$ is
\[
P^m(k\geq 1) = 1-(1-p)^m = 0.0392
\]

\end{proof}
